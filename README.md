# Mini Copilot, Fall 2024

In this project, we will attempt to recreate a GitHub Copilot. Since properly recreating the service requires an immense amount of compute for model training, we will seek to build a **Mini Copilot**. The purpose of this undertaking, and the materials in this repo, is purely educational.
